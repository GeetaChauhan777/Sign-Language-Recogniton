TOPIC- SIGN LANGUAGE RECOGNITION

     INTRODUCTION
The deaf and hard-of-hearing community has access to essential communication tools like sign language and hand gestures that help them engage with others. The creation of Hand Gesture Recognition Systems and Sign Language has been made possible by technological breakthroughs that aim to close the communication gap. In order to interpret and comprehend hand gestures and sign language, these systems use computer vision, machine learning, and pattern recognition algorithms. This helps people with hearing impairments and those who are not sign language experts communicate with one another. In order to improve accessibility and inclusion for people with hearing and speech impairments. Sign Language and Hand Gesture Recognition System's main objective is to enable effective and efficient communication. Through the translation of sign language and hand motions into text. These methods enable communication with a larger spectrum of individuals whether by voice or writing, dismantling obstacles and promoting equality. Understanding and interpreting the complex hand, finger, and facial expression movements and postures forms the basis of a Sign Language and Hand Gesture Recognition System. These systems may record and examine hand gestures by utilizing cameras, sensors, and specialized algorithms. They can do this by identifying the particular sign language symbols or hand gestures connected to words, sentences, or orders. Systems for recognizing hand gestures and sign language have a huge range of uses. Deaf and hard- of-hearing students can utilize them to successfully communicate with their peers and teachers in educational institutions by using them to enhance inclusive learning environments.

1.1	AN OVERVIEW
In this sign language recognition project, we create a sign detector, which detects alphabets that can very easily be extended to cover a vast multitude of other signs and hand gestures.
Every day we see many people who are facing illness like deaf, dumb and blind etc. They face difficulty to interact with others. Previously developed techniques are all sensors based and they didn’t give the general solution. The major goal of the proposed project is to create a cost-effective system that uses Smart Gloves to provide voice to the silent. Using a flex sensor and a microprocessor, the suggested method converts sign language into text and speech. It means that communication between two communities will not be hampered by the use of smart gloves.

1.2 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT

•	Recognition of hand signs
•	Enable effective communication
•	Interpret and recognize sign language gestures
•	Real-time processing

In healthcare facilities, these technologies help to increase patient and healthcare professional contact, guarantee correct information transmission, and offer a more individualized level of treatment.

1.3 OBJECTIVES
•	Bridges the communication gap between people who cannot speak and the general public.
•	Making a computer understand speech, facial expressions and human gestures are the main objective in this project.
•	Output in which result can be altered image or report that is based on image analysis.
•	To provide a simple, reliable sign language recognition system.
•	To optimize the model by a strong dataset and make it cost effective.
•	To create awareness regarding the importance of sign language.


    1.4 PROBLEM STATEMENT
A sign language and hand gesture recognition system solves the issue of the requirement for an automated and precise technique of understanding sign language and hand gestures. Hand gestures are frequently utilized for a variety of reasons, including human-computer interface, virtual reality, and robotics. Sign language is 
an essential tool for those with hearing problems. Manual interpretation and recognition of these motions, 
however, can be laborious, arbitrary, and prone to mistakes. The problem statement calls for the creation of a system that can accurately and effectively identify and interpret hand and sign language motions[8][13].

     1.5 MOTIVATION
The motivation behind a Sign Language and Hand Gesture Recognition System is its potential to increase accessibility, enable natural human-computer interaction, improve assistive technologies, facilitate education, foster communication, and increase the capabilities of robotics and virtual reality systems[3]. We can build a more welcoming and engaging world for people with different communication requirements by using technology to decipher and comprehend sign language and hand gestures.
